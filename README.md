## 🚀 Overview  
An **AI-powered chatbot** built with **Python, NLP, and Deep Learning**, designed to handle FAQs, customer queries, and conversational tasks with **context-aware intelligence**.  

This project showcases my **skills in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering** by integrating text preprocessing, ML/DL models, and web deployment tools into one cohesive system.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Languages**: Python 🐍  
- **NLP**: NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers  
- **Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)  
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras (LSTM)  
- **Backend**: Flask / FastAPI  
- **Database**: SQLite  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub  
- **Other Tools**: Logging, venv, .gitignore, Pickle

## ⚡ Challenges & Solutions  

| Challenge ⚠️ | Solution ✅ |
|--------------|------------|
| Large ML model files bloated Git repo | Added `.gitignore`, reinitialized clean repo |
| Maintaining chat context | Implemented session memory with SQLite |
| Slow responses from heavy models | Used lightweight Naive Bayes/LSTM for faster inference |
| Preprocessing noise reduced accuracy | Applied normalization (lemmatization + stopword removal) |
